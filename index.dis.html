        <p> I love to travel and some of my favorite places to visit are: </p>
        <h2>Lake Tahoe </h2>
        <h3>Reasons I love Lake Tahoe</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>snow!</li>
            <li>inner tubing</li>
            <li>hiking</li>
        </ul>
        <p>“When it comes to things to do in South Lake Tahoe, you can shred down the mountain from 10,067 ft. at
            Heavenly Mountain Resort’s peak or you can dive into the depths of Lake Tahoe. It’s more than 1600 ft. deep,
            making it one of the deepest lakes in North America. Needless to say, there’s plenty of things to do in Lake
            Tahoe above and below the surface.”</p>

        <p>“All parts of Lake Tahoe are beautiful and have something unique to offer. South Lake Tahoe is popular for
            its ski resorts like Heavenly, Sierra at Tahoe and Kirkwood ski resorts. South Lake Tahoe is also popular
            for its restaurants, shopping, casino resorts and vibrant nightlife.”</p>

        <h2>Rome</h2>
        <h3>Reasons I love Rome</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>history</li>
            <li>food</li>
            <li>architecture</li>
        </ul>
        <p>“Rome is a city of history, culture, art, food, fashion, and architecture. It’s a city that I have visited
            many times and I am always drawn back to it. There is so much to see and do in Rome that you could spend a
            lifetime here and not see it all. But if you only have a few days in Rome, you can still see a lot of the
            city.”</p>
